## The Odin Project - Kittens API

Set up a Rails app that is both a normal HTML-producing back end and an API that can be used to pull data from it. 

## Languages/Technologies used:
 - Rails 
 - Ruby
 - VS Code
 - Git/Github
 - RESTful APIs
 - Rest-client gem

## What I learned:
 - Practice making a simple CRUD Rails application
 - How to make the kittens resource available via API
    - Used #respond_to to render JSON
 
## Still can improve:
 - Kept this application very simple with no styling
